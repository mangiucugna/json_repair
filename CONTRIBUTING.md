# How to contribute

## Step 1. Open an Issue to describe what you intend to do
So that everyone is aware of the intention before getting a surprise PR

## Step 2. Work in a branch
Make sure to work in a branch to make it easier to create a new PR.

**Important: Update the unit tests each time!**
In fact I'd go out on a limb and say that you should use TDD for this project.

## Step 3. Run pre-commit
Make sure to have pre-commit installed as git hook for this repository and use a virtualenviroment.
This will run all the necessary tests and linters. Saving lots of time to the reviewers

## Step 4. Open a PR to review
Refer the Issue number in your PR

## Step 5. Approval
Profit!
